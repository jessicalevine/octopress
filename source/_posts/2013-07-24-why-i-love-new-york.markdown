Let's get something out of the way first: I love New York.

I *love* New York. I truly and completely love New York City. Consider that a bias throughout the entire post. In addition, D.C., San Francisco, Baltimore, Chicago, and Boston are the only big cities I've been to outside of New York. This means that there are a large number of cities, particularly outside the U.S., that I've never visited. There may very well be other cities that apply my favorite aspects of New York even better. Feel free to email me and let me know. It's my goal, however, to offer a small glimpse into the reasons why I love this city so much. As usual, let's start a list.

### The Subway System
Transportation is freedom. Growing up in rural Maryland, there were no sidewalks, let alone public transit. Everything was at least a few miles away. Unless you had a car—and a license—you were chained to your house. The best way to learn is by experience, and it's hard to experience anything when you're stuck in the same place. Coming to New York, and realizing I could get anywhere in the city, at almost any time, for two and a half dollars, was incredible. Even compared to the D.C. metro (expensive, sparse, and limited hours) or the San Fransisco BART (it just runs up the middle) it was so much better. I've yet to find a comparable public transit system in the U.S. 

Discussing this with a co-worker, he brought up an excellent point—in New York, you never had to plan how you were getting somewhere. No mess about who needs the car, whether the subway is still running, is there a bus stop, etc. Just look at the subway map, and figure out how to get there. Use Google Maps if you need a time estimate. When I stopped having to figure out *how* I was going to get somewhere, and only needed to manage how long it would take, the amount of stress removed from my life was more than I ever would have expected.

### The Diversity
I couldn't have predicted the importance of this aspect until I experienced it, and I didn't realize what a difference it made until I left. When you walk out on a New York street, you never know what you're going to see. It can be incredibly, incredibly strange—and I love this. I love the idea of a city where people feel comfortable enough to be whoever and whatever they want to be, publically, whenever they want.

However, it's not just about the edge cases. I love the fact that every person has a different style, race, gender, ethnicity, hobby, whatever. It lends the feeling that anything and everything can be found in New York. It's perhaps due to this that you always feel like you fit in. After all, if absolutely everything is here, how could you possibly not be welcome? I'll opt not to provide any negative examples for contrast, but it's a wonderfully inclusive feeling. 

### The Food
I'm not going to spend long here. What do you like to eat? OK, you can find it in New York. There’s variety, there’s quality, and Seamless delivers almost everything to everywhere. Personally, I like a variety of Asian cuisine, and I particularly love sushi—the level accessibility is awesome. 

### The New York Tech Community
I promised myself before writing this that I wouldn't delve into the cesspool that is the "Silicon Valley vs. New York" debate. I'm going to stick to this promise. But I will mention what I do love:

* Some of my favorite, world-changing startups (Kickstarter, Codecademy) are based in New York.
* The community is incredibly close-knit. Most everyone in New York tech know each other, communicate regularly, and share back to the ecosystem as a whole.
* Everything that *isn't* the New York tech community. It's much easier to work in tech (and live a happy, healthy life) when I am surrounded by a variety of people and things that are not in tech.

### The Density
This aspect is a little bit fuzzier, and a little bit more personal. I love being surrounded—by people, buildings, organizations, events, what have you. For one, I feel safe in the crowd, but more importantly, it makes me happy to see so many people, doing what they want and making themselves happy.

### The People
This one is also fuzzy, and based on an even more statistically insignificant sample than the rest—but when I go out on the street, people are *nice*. Drop something? People will pick it up and bring it to you. Run into someone accidentally? Both of you rapidly apologize and check if the other is ok—no matter whose fault it was. Smiles and laughs abound. I a singular memory of someone snapping at me on the street for bumping into them. It sticks out vividly, because it's so rare and out of place—I couldn't imagine it happening.

### Everything Else
I could spend just about forever listing the little things that make New York amazing—the architecture, the niche communities, the events, so on, so forth. But altogether, it can be summarized as "I love this city", and "I want to move here in a more permanent way as fast as possible." I have no idea how to leave it, for the second time, come two weeks from Saturday.
